> The BioHackathon in Japan, organized by the Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS), continues to prioritize the integrated use
> of databases in the life sciences, with a strong emphasis on interoperability, standardization, and the construction of FAIR
> knowledge graphs. In recent years, the development of tools and workflows for integrating heterogeneous biological and biomedical
> data—including multi-omics, imaging, clinical, and environmental data—has become increasingly central. This integration is key
> to enabling cross-domain analysis and improving reproducibility in data-driven research.
