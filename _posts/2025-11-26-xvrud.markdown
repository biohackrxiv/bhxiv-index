Scop3PTM Next was developed during BioHackathon Europe 2025 to address the need for integrated visualization of protein-centric data across sequence (and modification),
interaction and structural contexts. The project delivers an open-source library of modular JavaScript components, built with Vue.js and documented with Storybook,
enabling reusable and interoperable visualizations. The framework provides 1D sequence tracks, contact-map networks and interactive 3D structural renders, using
MolSpecView for rendering 3D structures linked to Nightingale 1D tracks. Together, these components offer a unified interface for exploring PTM features across
multiple representational layers. This work establishes the basis for a community-oriented visualization library to support proteomics analysis.
