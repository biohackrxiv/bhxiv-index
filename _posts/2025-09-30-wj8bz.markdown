The Minimum Information Required for A Glycomics Experiment (MIRAGE) guidelines have
established comprehensive reporting standards for glycomics research, yet their implementation
in semantic web technologies remains limited. We present the first comprehensive semantic
formalization of MIRAGE guidelines through an integrated RDF ontology framework comprising
the MIRAGE Ontology and MIRAGE-DCAT3 vocabulary. The MIRAGE Ontology
models glycan structures, biological specimens, analytical instruments, and experimental
processes with formal OWL semantics and SHACL validation constraints. The complementary
MIRAGE-DCAT3 vocabulary extends W3C DCAT3 with glycomics-specific metadata properties
for dataset cataloging and discovery. Our implementation addresses critical challenges in
glycomics data interoperability through comprehensive mappings to established ontologies
including GlycoRDF, PSI-MS, and DCTERMS. This semantic framework enables automated
quality assessment, federated data querying, and enhanced reproducibility in glycomics research,
supporting broader adoption of FAIR principles in the glycobiology community. The
framework demonstrates comprehensive coverage of MIRAGE reporting requirements across
multiple analytical platforms including mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography, capillary
electrophoresis, NMR spectroscopy, and lectin microarray analysis.
