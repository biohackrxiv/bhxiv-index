The landscape of genomic wastewater surveillance in the context of infectious disease monitoring is rapidly evolving, and this came into sharp focus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we highlight the significance of wastewater surveillance as a passive monitoring system complementary to clinical genomic surveillance activities. Emphasizing the need for coordination, standardization, and the development of a unified catalog of software tools and services, we aim to streamline the implementation of end-to-end genomic wastewater surveillance pipelines.Key considerations such as defining variants, understanding antimicrobial resistance, and assessing viral fitness within the framework of wastewater surveillance are explored, linking to examples of respective tools and existing pipelines. The challenges of wastewater data analysis, the need for specialized tools and bioinformatics workflows, and the significance of integrated pipelines are also discussed in detail. The article presents case studies, including the V-pipe integrated bioinformatics workflow and the integration of tools into the Galaxy platform, underscoring their role in enhancing data analysis efficiency and standardization within the field.Overall, the review highlights the critical importance of continued research efforts to advance understanding and implementation of bioinformatic approaches in wastewater surveillance for the effective monitoring and management of infectious diseases.
