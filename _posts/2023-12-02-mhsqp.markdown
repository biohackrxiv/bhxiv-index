This report provides an overview of the significant accomplishments achieved during the ELIXIR Biohackathon 2023 under Project 17: "Extending interoperability of experimental data using modular queries across biomedical resources". The project diligently addressed four key aspects: the expansion of data resources, the creation of knowledge graphs, advancements in data visualization, and the development of a use-case-driven pipeline. The collective efforts during the Biohackathon aimed to enhance the integration and accessibility of experimental data across diverse biomedical resources by developing a tool named BioDataFuse.
