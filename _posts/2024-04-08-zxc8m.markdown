Systems biology (SB) is a new ELIXIR community, that aims to utilise the ELIXIR ecosystem, such as the Training eSupport System (TeSS) and bio.tools, a registry of software tools and data resources for life sciences. One of the main initial objectives of the SB community is to create an SB-themed domain hosted by TeSS, encompassing SB-related ELIXIR services and events, in a fully automated way.Most content in TeSS is sourced through automated aggregation (“scraping”) of external sources containing resources marked up with semantic metadata, like Bioschemas. Currently, TeSS cannot recognize references to bio.tools identifiers from a Bioschemas-annotated resource, so the number of resources linked to bio.tools is relatively low.In this project, we will focus on selected SB disciplines from the priority areas of the ELXIR SB community to integrate and cross-link related ELIXIR products - training events, training materials, computational and bioinformatics tools, databases and services from the bio.tools registry.This will be achieved using suitable ontologies identified by the SB community and by careful curation of SB-related materials. We aim to extend this work to other ELIXIR products such as lists of trainers, related ELIXIR Innovation and Industry events and publications. This will serve as a pilot project leading to broader integration with other SB disciplines, and will be of interest to several other ELIXIR communities.
