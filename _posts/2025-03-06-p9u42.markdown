The first BioHackrXiv preprint was published in 2020, using a platform based on the idea of using Markdown,
and just weeks ago, BioHackrXiv published their 100th preprint. Machine-readable etadata added to the Markdown
that is added includes the title, keywords, the author names, their affiliations, and details about the
Biohackathon event the preprint is related to. The metadata in 2000 already supported listing the ORCID
identifier of the authors, but this was not added to the author list in the generated PDF. This report
describes two improvements of the platform: visualization of the ORCID identifiers in the preprint PDF
and support for Research Organization Registry (ROR) identifiers of the affiliations.
