Japan’s National Agriculture and Food Research Organization initiated a collaborative research project with France’s National Research Institute
for Agriculture, Food and Environment to evaluate wheat genetic resources and to identify materials with desirable traits using standardized
criteria. This paper presents the current status of trait data standardization between the two organizations and outlines a direction for
standardization. Trait data for genetic resources in Japan and France are managed using independently developed standards. The lack of mapping
standards hinders data integration and interoperability. To support experts in the mapping process, we developed a tool that translates trait
terms. A generative AI-based translation tool appears to be applicable for collecting relevant information to support mapping between trait
terms, as well as translating newly submitted Japanese trait terms into English.
