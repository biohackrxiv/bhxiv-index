As part of the virtual BioHackathon 2020, we formed a working group that focused on the analysis of gene expression in the context of COVID-19. More specifically, we performed transcriptome analyses on published datasets in order to better understand the interaction between the human host and the SARS-CoV-2 virus.The ideas proposed during this hackathon were divided into five projects. Projects 1 and 2 aimed to identify human genes that are important in the process of viral infection of human cells. Projects 3 and 4 aimed to take the candidate genes identified in projects 1 and 2, as well as by independent studies, and relate them to clinical information and to possible therapeutic interventions. Finally, Project 5 aimed to package and containerize software and workflows used and generated here in a reusable manner, ultimately providing scalable and reproducible workflows.
