The 2024 BGE Barcoding Hackathon, hosted by the Biodiversity Genomics Europe (BGE) project in Leiden, Netherlands, focused on
advancing digital infrastructures and data handling practices for single specimen barcoding. This event brought together 24
participants from various consortium member institutes to enhance workflows in DNA barcoding, which complements genome sequencing
efforts within BGE. The hackathon was structured around four thematic pillars: Data Generation and Processing, BOLD Release
Candidate, Wider Data Integration, and Reference Data Curation. Participants worked on optimizing barcode generation pipelines,
developing a new version of the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) data publishing platform, harmonizing data standards for
better integration with databases like ENA and UNITE, and automating curation processes for DNA barcoding records. The outcomes
include improved workflows, enhanced data interoperability, and refined curation standards, which collectively support BGE's
goals of achieving a step change in molecular biodiversity monitoring and research.
