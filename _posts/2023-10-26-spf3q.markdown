In addition to functional annotation of genes, annotating genes to pathways is important in current molecular biology.But, pathway diagrams are required to annotate genes to nodes of those.Therefore, it is important to draw pathway diagrams with assignment to genes and metabolites.Existing metabolic pathway databases focus on generic pathways, while secondary metabolism is emphasized in organisms producing useful substances.Moreover they cannot accept third party annotation of those data.A practical system for pathway analyses is therefore really needed.Following on from the previous BioHackathon (BH23), we first discussed how to create a database of pathway information in non-model species in a domestic version of the BioHackathon called BH23.9 held in Shirahama, Wakayama, Japan (25-29 September 2023).We then gave a tutorial on how to write a pathway diagram using PathVisio, which is a free open-source pathway analysis and drawing software which allows drawing, editing, and analyzing biological pathways. Finally we tried to establish the conversion system from text data to Graphical Pathway Markup Language (GPML), which is called txt2gpml.txt2gpml will drastically reduce the time and effort required to create pathway diagrams.After a stimulus discussion in BH23 and BH23.9, we could clarify the current issues in the pathway analysis for non-model organisms.
