Optimal formats to inform and engage young students in novel biology-related fields are short courses. Training schools, e.g. those lasting for five days, can provide enough content to introduce students to an extensive overview of bioinformatics and scientific career opportunities.In this work, we define a five-day training school format tailored to three target groups of young students: high school students, undergraduate students in biology-related fields and undergraduate students in computational fields. We structure the content and sessions around learning areas consisting of learning topics, detailing the dependencies between them.For each learning topic, we define learning outcomes and learning activities. Moreover, we conceptualize a teaching platform to manage FAIRyfied (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) training materials that anyone will be able to use to design a new training school in bioinformatics.
