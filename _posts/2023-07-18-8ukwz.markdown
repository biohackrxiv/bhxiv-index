LinkML is a data modeling language that can be used to describe the structure and semantics of data from a specific domain. But as with any modeling language, there is a need for tools that support validation of data. The LinkML provides a set of validation tools but there is a growing need to adapt the tools for a broader audience. The work highlighted in this report describes the efforts of redesigning the validation framework in LinkML to better support a wider range of validation scenarios and use cases.
