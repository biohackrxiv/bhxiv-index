As part of the one week Biohackathion 2019 in Fukuoka Japan, we formed a working group on logic programming for the biomedical sciences. Logic programming is understood by many bioinformaticians when it is presented in the form of relational SQL queries or SPARQL queries. More advanced logic programming, however, is underutilized in bioinformatics.
