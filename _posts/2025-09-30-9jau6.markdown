The SRAmetaDBB project, presented at BioHackathon Japan 2023, introduced an experimental JavaScript pipeline
for creating SQLite databases from NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archive) metadata dumps, with a vision for offline
analysis and integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
While promising, the prototype faced significant challenges in performance, memory management, and production
readiness when scaling to the full SRA dataset of over 45 million records. This paper presents SRAKE (SRA
Knowledge Engine), a complete reimplementation in Go that not only addresses these limitations but extends
the original vision with semantic search capabilities, quality control mechanisms, and multiple access
interfaces. SRAKE achieves a 20-fold improvement in ingestion speed, maintains constant memory usage through
zero-copy streaming, and provides standards-compliant interfaces following clig.dev guidelines. The platform
introduces biomedical-specific semantic search using SapBERT embeddings via ONNX Runtime, implements
comprehensive quality control thresholds for search results, and offers multiple access modalities including
a CLI, REST API, MCP server for AI integration, and a simple web interface. Our development implementation
demonstrates that SRAKE successfully transforms the experimental SRAmetaDBB concept into a production-ready
platform, and seamless integration with modern AI workflows while maintaining the core vision of providing
offline-capable, LLM-ready access to SRA metadata.
